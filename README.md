Editoo
===

Editoo is my first try to implement a fully object oriented Wysiwyg Texteditor using Mootools 1.11

What it is
---

It is a very early alpha version, developed in 2008.

I tried to implement this editor, because there were no editor that fitted my needs for an small, fast and Mootools based Wysiwyg Texteditor.

But since then i hadn't enought spare time to set this project on a stable ground.

So i used the very overloaded and lame FCK Editor instead. It works well.

What it isn't
---

It IS NOT a STABLE release.

So don't use it on production systems!

What it's for
---

It is for you. Feel free to set it to solid base.
